# Deep_Learning_Analysis

## Overview
- The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, youâ€™ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Questions
What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model? "IS_SUCCESSFUL"
What variable(s) are the features for your model? "APPLICATION_TYPE", "AFFILIATION", "CLASSIFICATION", "CLASSIFICATION", "USE_CASE", "ORGANIZATION", "INCOME_AMT", "SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS", and "ASK_AMT".
What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features? "EIN" and "NAME"
